# Group tables define the third-level headings used to organize commits in the changelog.
# Each group has the following properties:
#   - name: Display name for the group (should match the table name)
#   - publish: Controls whether this group appears in the published changelog
#   - cc-types: Array of conventional commit types that belong to this group
#
# To add a new group:
#   1. Copy an existing group table
#   2. Update the table name (e.g., [groups.MyGroup])
#   3. Set the name field to match the table name
#   4. Add the appropriate conventional commit types to cc-types
#
# Example:
# [groups.MyGroup]
# name = "MyGroup"
# publish = true
# cc-types = ["mygroup"]
# 
# Note: Each commit type should only belong to one group.
